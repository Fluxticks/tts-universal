This discord bot was written mostly to improve the generated embeds of the common social media links posted.
It also serves as a bot to incorporate other useful features to avoid needing multiple bots that are not FOSS.
This bot is maintained by myself in my freetime and it's features are heavily influenced by the needs of my friends and I ðŸ™‚.

# Quick Setup Guide

Requirements needed to run:

- Python 3.8
- Pip
- [A postgres 11 database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/admin.html)
  - If using the `DB_OVERRIDE` environment variable, any valid DB schema for SQLAlchemy can be used by providing the correct schema URI. These can be [found here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/dialects/).
- To use the `RedditEmbed` extension, you need to create a Reddit "Personal Use Script" [application](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps). If you are unsure, use `http://localhost:8080` for your redirect_uri.

# Contributing Guide

If you wish to contribute you should also install the requirements in `dev-requirements.txt`.
If you make any changes to this bot please use the following paradigms:

- Ensure that yapf is configured with the configuration defined in `setup.cfg`
  - Optionally also configure flake8 to help with linting
  - This project uses match/case statements, consider using [char101's fork](https://github.com/char101/yapf/releases/tag/v0.31.0) of YAPF until the official fork addresses [the issue](https://github.com/google/yapf/issues/983)
- When adding a new extension consider the following:
  - Create user-facing strings inside of `src/locale/` using the same name as the extension of the filename (eg. for VoiceAdmin.py extension, there exists VoiceAdmin.toml). The strings can then be loaded with `load_cog_strings(__name__)` from `common.io`
  - Extensions should be modular, meaning that they should be able to be enabled/disabled with hindering the function of other extensions
- Any file loading or IO operations should be defined in `src/common/io.py`
